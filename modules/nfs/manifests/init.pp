# == Class: nfs
#
# Installs and Configures Logstash from packages.
# Currently only for RHEL6 and derivatives
#
# This module is only really here for completeness, it is not actually used. Instead, just call nfs::server directly.
#
# In the future there may be a partnering nfs::client module, but I have not got round to it yet (if ever).
